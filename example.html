                <h3>Tech Expo</h3>
                <p>Kent School District students use technology to learn new skills to prepare for their future every day. Our classrooms are places where students are able to try new ways to learn important concepts and, more importantly, college and career skills. Students in the One-to-One Laptop Program have access to 21st Century learning anytime, from anywhere.</p>

                <p>Kent School District’s annual Technology Expo showcases how students gain college and career skills through classroom projects using technology tools. At the event, students and teachers will demonstrate technology in use, speak about what they have learned, and ask attendees to get involved by solving a problem, completing a task, building a device, and much more. Members of the STEP Team assist with the organization and assembly of the event. Members also host a booth for the STEP Team and VisFest showcasing what we do. </p>

                <p>This event also highlights local businesses and organizations who support and use technology. These business sponsors and exhibitors help demonstrate the connection between classrooms and careers.</p>

                <h3>VisFest</h3>
                <p>Since 2002, the Kent School District together with the STEP Team has hosted the VisFest Annual Visual Literacy Arts Festival. Through the years, VisFest has provided thousands of Kent area students an outlet to display their creative and artistic visual literacy talents to a wide audience of fellow students, teachers, and members of the community.</p>

                <p>We play several roles in this event ranging from judging and scoring the entries to managing and hosting the Awards Ceremony. Currently, VisFest includes a Film Festival and a Video Game Expo.</p>

                <h3>STAR</h3>
                <p>There are four components to the STAR Initiative: Student, Technology, Access, and Resources. In order to achieve the Kent School District mission of preparing each and every student for a successful future, students must have technology, they must have online access, and they must have a variety of digital resources that support instruction and learning. Leveling the playing field by providing technology, access, and resources for all students is a critical component for increasing student achievement.</p>

                <p>The STEP Team is involved in most of the STAR program but most directly in managing the Technology component. In an effort to bridge the “digital divide” among Kent School District students, STAR Laptop Grant Program, formerly known as Bridging the Gap, grants refurbished laptops to qualified families among our student population.</p>
